                    <p>The core of our safety is **prevention**. The system constantly processes real-time data against predefined safety rules and historical risk patterns.</p>

                        <p>Machine Learning models analyze travel speed, deviation from itinerary, time spent stationary, and localized crime data. If a tourist's behavior deviates from the norm, the **AI flags an Anomaly** and triggers a soft, automated check-in with the tourist.</p>

                        <p>Virtual boundaries are placed around restricted areas, known high-risk zones, or protected natural sites. If a tourist's device crosses a Geo-Fence, the system sends an **instant, location-specific warning** to the traveler and a low-level alert to the Unified Command Dashboard.</p>

                <p>When an SOS is activated, the **AI-powered alert** is instantly validated against the **Blockchain ID**. This combined validation allows emergency services to immediately know *who* they are rescuing, *where* they are, and *what* their medical needs are, cutting response time by up to 50%.</p>
